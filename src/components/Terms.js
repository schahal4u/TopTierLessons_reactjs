              <p className="header_privacy">
                &bull; Site is a Venue. The Site provides a venue for people
                seeking Site is a Venue. The Site provides a venue for people
                seeking lesson services ("Parents") to connect with people who
                want to provide those services ("Athletes," and collectively
                with Parents, "Users"). TopTier is not a referral, matching or
                placement service and does not provide, refer, place, offer or
                seek to obtain employment or engagements for any of its Users.
                TopTier does not control or direct the Athletes’ performance of
                their services or set their work locations, work hours, or terms
                of work. Businesses procure and Athletes provide services under
                their own name or business name, and not under TopTIer’s name.
                Users provide their own tools and supplies to perform their
                Engagements; TopTier does not provide the tools or supplies. All
                Users are free to maintain business without any restrictions
                from TopTIer and are free to offer and provide their services
                elsewhere, including through competing platforms. TopTier has no
                obligation to screen or verify the identity or background of any
                User. TopTier does not screen or verify the training or
                experience of any of the Users, including Users who have
                Subscriptions, or any content submitted by a User or anyone
                other than TopTier ("User Content"), including but not limited
                to User Profiles and Reviews. TopTier has no control over the
                accuracy, reliability, completeness or timeliness of Profiles,
                Reviews, background check information, affiliations or other
                User Content submitted on the Site, and makes no representations
                about any such User Content on the Site TopTier further makes no
                representations about the Athletes or the Parents. You should
                make your own assessments of the persons you decide to interact
                with, engage or provide services to.
              </p>
              <p className="header_privacy">
                &bull; Transactions Are Solely Between Users. TopTier is not
                involved in the Service arrangements between Users. Users
                arrange for the Services solely between themselves, and TopTier
                is not a party to any of those arrangements. TopTier does not
                have control, supervise or provide any training or equipment to
                the Athletes, and has no control over the quality, timing,
                legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of
                the services provided by Athletes. Because we are not involved
                in User-to-User dealings or control the behavior of Users, Users
                must resolve any issues, disputes or concerns directly with each
                other, including any issues regarding payments to an Athlete or
                services received by a Parent. As set forth in Section 15, you
                agree to release TopTier from any claims or liability that may
                arise from any disputes between you and other Users. TopTier is
                not an employment service and does not serve as an employer of
                any User. As such, Users are solely responsible (and TopTier is
                not responsible), for any tax, workers’ compensation insurance,
                withholding or reporting, including, but not limited to,
                unemployment insurance, social security or payroll withholding
                tax or income reporting in connection with any services provided
                by Users. You understand and agree that if TopTier is found to
                be liable for any tax, workers’ compensation insurance,
                withholding tax or reporting obligation in connection with any
                services provided or received by you, then you will immediately
                reimburse and indemnify TopTier for all costs, expenses and
                liabilities (including any interest and penalties) relating to
                the same. If requested by TopTier, you agree to provide TopTier
                with such identification documents (including social security
                numbers, tax ID numbers, copies of passports and driver's
                licenses) or other information as may be needed or requested by
                TopTier.

                services (each, a "3rd Party Verification Service'') made

                check and an Athletes or Parent’s relationship with the 3rd

                Verification Services website's terms of service and privacy

                information or your compliance with these Terms of Service. If
                the 3rd Party Verification Service reports that a Athlete has
                cleared the 3rd Party Verification Services background check, at
                TopTier’s discretion, this information may be included on the
                Athletes Profile along with the date the Athlete completed the
                background check for a period of up to 13 months from the
                background check date (it shall be the Athletes responsibility
                to reinitiate, if the Athlete chooses, a new background check;
                failure to initiate and clear a new background check may result
                in the Athlete being unable to use the Services). Each User
                understands that TopTier retains the right, but has no
                obligation, to take action with respect to an Athletes TopTier
                account based on the information provided by the 3rd Party
                Verification Service, including, but not limited to, terminating

                Service is subsequently corrected or completed. TopTier does not

                Verification Service that provided the information (and not

                consents to TopTier performing background and/or verification
                checks on such Athlete to the extent permitted by law. If you,
                as a Athlete, do not want these checks performed, do not use the

                period at the then-current rate for annual Subscriptions. For
                any automatic renewal, you authorize TopTier to charge your
                selected payment method the then-current applicable fee in
                accordance with the Subscription plan you selected. To cancel
                your Subscription, complete the subscription cancellation form.
                The cancellation will be effective at the end of your then
                current Subscription term. If you cancel your Subscription, you
                will continue to have access to your Premium Services associated
                with your Subscription until the cancellation becomes effective.
                All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds
                or credits once your account has been billed, including if you
                cancel your Subscription and/or account. All Premium Services
                cease when your Subscription's cancellation becomes effective;
                your Subscription will not renew thereafter. Upon the effective
                cancellation of your Subscription, you will no longer have
                access to Premium Services, but you will continue to have access
                to your account and portions of the Site and Services that are
                available to Users who do not have Subscriptions. Canceling your
                Subscription will not delete your account. To deactivate your

                for the Subscription on the first day following the end of the
                free trial period, on a recurring monthly or annual basis or as
                otherwise described in the offer for the free trial. To avoid
                such charges, Users with free trial Subscriptions must cancel
                their Subscription before the end of the free trial period.
                Promotional Offers, which may include discount codes or account
                credits toward fees, may be subject to expiration dates and may
                only be applicable to select Users. <br /> <br /> &bull; Payment

                TopTier storing your payment card information. Users with
                Subscriptions are responsible for maintaining current and
